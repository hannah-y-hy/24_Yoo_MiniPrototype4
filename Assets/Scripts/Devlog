Last Prototype plan
*Wrote right after in-class discussion time

<Summary>
Making Prototype 4 into a 2 player an arcade machine two joysticks
* Initial prototype 4 had a method that certain score triggering in-game events(e.g. player gameobject transforming in every 3 points) but that seemed to make some confusion for players so I'm thinking of making another player-related event instead

<Things I have to do>
1. simplifying gameplay by reducing/deleting existing in-game events
2. random joystick control switching method between 2 players
    e.g.:player 1 normally uses joystick 1 and player 2 uses joystick 2,
        but during specific times, the players' controls will swap randomly so that they could inturrupt each other for real, sitting in front of the arcade machine 

<Classes and method Variables>
1. GameManager
->Just adding some method related to joystick switching
    bool isControlSwitched: if control switch is active, do something
    float controlSwitchDuration: Duration of control switch
    float controlSwitchCooldown: Cooldown time before switching controls again.

2. JoystickSwitchManager 
: related to joystic switching 
    void TriggerControlSwitch(): Makes joystick swapping happen
    void ResetControlSwitch(): Resets control to original state after duration.

<PsudoCode for player appearance(or paddle size) changing
If player presses joystick button 1, pingpong paddle gameobject changes its appearance to version 2
    -> find prefab with "Paddle Appearance" tag in list
Pressing again: changing into appearance version 3
    ->and then 30-sec cool time starts: this limitaion is for avoiding the player making too much transformation


<UX designing tips>
1. player goal: what do they think their goal is?
2. Design goal: what does the player see?
3. emotional beat
    -> Write every 1 row for every events/happening/changes


<Things that I might wanna try / some ideas>
if the player touches diagnal control, paddle movement becomes slower: this could make players to be really careful, like really playing a pingpong game
...or paddles wobbling?
